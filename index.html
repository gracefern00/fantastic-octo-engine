      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! Thank you for taking a look at my profile. I am currently a full time employee with Cox Communications, while also studying Full Stack Web Development on the side. Please see below for some examples of my work!</p>
        <p>Outside of work and class, I lead a rich and vibrant life online, and can frequently be found in discord chatting with friends or playing video games. My favorite genre is horror and I recently completed the entire Outlast franchise and am working through the Resident Evils. I also have a cat who I love very much, and also taught myself how to rollerskate. I would love to live and work overseas one day, and I'm hoping that learning to code will open up some new opportunities for me!</p>
