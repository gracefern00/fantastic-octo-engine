## Description

This profile was created to showcase my work. At this time it is a placeholder, and will be updated as I progress in my coding journey.
I wasn't to create a stylized page that demonstated my personality but also showcases my skillset as it grows over time.
It organizes my best projects in one place, and will be a great reference for personal use and potentially employment.
I learned a lot more about how to use flexbox and CSS styling during this project but will be refining it over time.

## Usage

This website is to be used as a reference for my work. You can navigate using the link at the top of the page, and eventually navigate to completed projects under the work section, where there are currently placeholder images of my cat.
